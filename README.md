#shapefiles

A repo of useful shapefiles. All files should be formatted location-type(singular)-year-resolution.ext, e.g. us-county-2019-100k.topo.json. For some files, the resolution is not available. Some files have been simplified from their original resolution, either because they were simply unnecessarily large or in order to meet GitHub's 100MB file size limit.
